      Near the Levée, and not far from the old French Cathedral in the Place
      d&rsquo;Armes, at New Orleans, stands a fine date-palm, thirty feet in height,
      spreading its broad leaves in the alien air as hardily as if its sinuous
      roots were sucking strength from their native earth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Sir Charles Lyell, in his Second Visit to the United States, mentions this
      exotic: &ldquo;The tree is seventy or eighty years old; for Père Antoine, a
      Roman Catholic priest, who died about twenty years ago, told Mr. Bringier
      that he planted it himself, when he was young. In his will he provided
      that they who succeeded to this lot of ground should forfeit it if they
      cut down the palm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wishing to learn something of Père Antoine&rsquo;s history, Sir Charles Lyell
      made inquiries among the ancient créole inhabitants of the faubourg. That
      the old priest, in his last days, became very much emaciated, that he
      walked about the streets like a mummy, that he gradually dried up, and
      finally blew away, was the meagre and unsatisfactory result of the
      tourist&rsquo;s investigations. This is all that is generally told of Père
      Antoine. In the summer of 1861, while New Orleans was yet occupied by the
      Confederate forces, I met at Alexandria, in Virginia, a lady from
      Louisiana&mdash;Miss Blondeau by name&mdash;who gave me the substance of
      the following legend touching Père Antoine and his wonderful date-palm. If
      it should appear tame to the reader, it will be because I am not habited
      in a black ribbed-silk dress, with a strip of point-lace around my throat,
      like Miss Blondeau; it will be because I lack her eyes and lips and
      Southern music to tell it with.
    </p>
    <p>
      When Père Antoine was a very young man, he had a friend whom he loved as
      he loved his life. Emile Jardin returned his passion, and the two, on
      account of their friendship, became the marvel of the city where they
      dwelt. One was never seen without the other; for they studied, walked,
      ate, and slept together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus began Miss Blondeau, with the air of Fiammetta telling her prettiest
      story to the Florentines in the garden of Boccaccio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Antoine and Emile were preparing to enter the Church; indeed, they had
      taken the preliminary steps, when a circumstance occurred which changed
      the color of their lives. A foreign lady, from some nameless island in the
      Pacific, had a few months before moved into their neighborhood. The lady
      died suddenly, leaving a girl of sixteen or seventeen, entirely friendless
      and unprovided for. The young men had been kind to the woman during her
      illness, and at her death&mdash;melting with pity at the forlorn situation
      of Anglice, the daughter&mdash;swore between themselves to love and watch
      over her as if she were their sister.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now Anglice had a wild, strange beauty that made other women seem tame
      beside her; and in the course of time the young men found themselves
      regarding their ward not so much like brothers as at first. In brief, they
      found themselves in love with her.
    </p>
    <p>
      They struggled with their hopeless passion month after month, neither
      betraying his secret to the other; for the austere orders which they were
      about to assume precluded the idea of love and marriage. Until then they
      had dwelt in the calm air of religious meditations, unmoved except by that
      pious fervor which in other ages taught men to brave the tortures of the
      rack and to smile amid the flames. But a blonde girl, with great eyes and
      a voice like the soft notes of a vesper hymn, had come in between them and
      their ascetic dreams of heaven. The ties that had bound the young men
      together snapped silently one by one. At last each read in the pale face
      of the other the story of his own despair.
    </p>
    <p>
      And she? If Anglice shared their trouble, her face told no story. It was
      like the face of a saint on a cathedral window. Once, however, as she came
      suddenly upon the two men and overheard words that seemed to burn like
      fire on the lip of the speaker, her eyes grew luminous for an instant.
      Then she passed on, her face as immobile as before in its setting of wavy
      gold hair.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &ldquo;Entre or et roux Dieu fit ses longs cheveux.&rdquo;
 </pre>
    <p>
      One night Emile and Anglice were missing. They had flown&mdash;but
      whither, nobody knew, and nobody, save Antoine, cared. It was a heavy blow
      to Antoine&mdash;for he had himself half resolved to confess his love to
      Anglice and urge her to fly with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      A strip of paper slipped from a volume on Antoine&rsquo;s prie-dieu, and
      fluttered to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Do not be angry,</i>&rdquo; said the bit of paper, piteously; &ldquo;<i>forgive
      us, for we love</i>.&rdquo; (Par-donnez-nous, car nous aimons.)
    </p>
    <p>
      Three years went by wearily enough. Antoine had entered the Church, and
      was already looked upon as a rising man; but his face was pale and his
      heart leaden, for there was no sweetness in life for him.
    </p>
    <p>
      Four years had elapsed, when a letter, covered with outlandish postmarks,
      was brought to the young priest&mdash;a letter from Anglice. She was
      dying;&mdash;would he forgive her? Emile, the year previous, had fallen a
      victim to the fever that raged on the island; and their child, Anglice,
      was likely to follow him. In pitiful terms she begged Antoine to take
      charge of the child until she was old enough to enter the convent of the
      Sacré-Cour. The epistle was finished hastily by another hand, informing
      Antoine of Madame Jardin&rsquo;s death; it also told him that Anglice had been
      placed on board a vessel shortly to leave the island for some Western
      port.
    </p>
    <p>
      The letter, delayed by storm and shipwreck, was hardly read and wept over
      when little Anglice arrived.
    </p>
    <p>
      On beholding her, Antoine uttered a cry of joy and surprise&mdash;she was
      so like the woman he had worshipped.
    </p>
    <p>
      The passion that had been crowded down in his heart broke out and lavished
      its rich-ness on this child, who was to him not only the Anglice of years
      ago, but his friend Emile Jardin also.
    </p>
    <p>
      Anglice possessed the wild, strange beauty of her mother&mdash;the
      bending, willowy form, the rich tint of skin, the large tropical eyes,
      that had almost made Antoine&rsquo;s sacred robes a mockery to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      For a month or two Anglice was wildly unhappy in her new home. She talked
      continually of the bright country where she was born, the fruits and
      flowers and blue skies, the tall, fan-like trees, and the streams that
      went murmuring through them to the sea. Antoine could not pacify her.
    </p>
    <p>
      By and by she ceased to weep, and went about the cottage in a weary,
      disconsolate way that cut Antoine to the heart. A long-tailed paroquet,
      which she had brought with her in the ship, walked solemnly behind her
      from room to room, mutely pining, it seemed, for those heavy orient airs
      that used to ruffle its brilliant plumage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before the year ended, he noticed that the ruddy tinge had faded from her
      cheek, that her eyes had grown languid, and her slight figure more willowy
      than ever.
    </p>
    <p>
      A physician was consulted. He could discover nothing wrong with the child,
      except this fading and drooping. He failed to account for that. It was
      some vague disease of the mind, he said, beyond his skill.
    </p>
    <p>
      So Anglice faded day after day. She seldom left the room now. At last
      Antoine could not shut out the fact that the child was passing away. He
      had learned to love her so!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dear heart,&rdquo; he said once, &ldquo;what is&rsquo;t ails thee?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nothing, mon père,&rdquo; for so she called him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The winter passed, the balmy spring had come with its magnolia blooms and
      orange blossoms, and Anglice seemed to revive. In her small bamboo chair,
      on the porch, she swayed to and fro in the fragrant breeze, with a
      peculiar undulating motion, like a graceful tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      At times something seemed to weigh upon her mind. Antoine observed it, and
      waited. Finally she spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Near our house,&rdquo; said little Anglice&mdash;&ldquo;near our house, on the
      island, the palm-trees are waving under the blue sky. Oh, how beautiful! I
      seem to lie beneath them all day long. I am very, very happy. I yearned
      for them so much that I grew ill&mdash;don&rsquo;t you think it was so, mon
      père?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hélas, yes!&rdquo; exclaimed Antoine, suddenly. &ldquo;Let us hasten to those
      pleasant islands where the palms are waving.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Anglice smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am going there, mon père.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A week from that evening the wax candles burned at her feet and forehead,
      lighting her on the journey.
    </p>
    <p>
      All was over. Now was Antoine&rsquo;s heart empty. Death, like another Emile,
      had stolen his new Anglice. He had nothing to do but to lay the blighted
      flower away.
    </p>
    <p>
      Père Antoine made a shallow grave in his garden, and heaped the fresh
      brown mould over his idol.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the tranquil spring evenings, the priest was seen sitting by the mound,
      his finger closed in the unread breviary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The summer broke on that sunny land; and in the cool morning twilight, and
      after nightfall, Antoine lingered by the grave. He could never be with it
      enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      One morning he observed a delicate stem, with two curiously shaped emerald
      leaves, springing up from the centre of the mound. At first he merely
      noticed it casually; but presently the plant grew so tall, and was so
      strangely unlike anything he had ever seen before, that he examined it
      with care.
    </p>
    <p>
      How straight and graceful and exquisite it was! When it swung to and fro
      with the summer wind, in the twilight, it seemed to Antoine as if little
      Anglice were standing there in the garden.
    </p>
    <p>
      The days stole by, and Antoine tended the fragile shoot, wondering what
      manner of blossom it would unfold, white, or scarlet, or golden. One
      Sunday, a stranger, with a bronzed, weather-beaten face like a sailor&rsquo;s,
      leaned over the garden rail, and said to him,
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a fine young date-palm you have there, sir!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mon Dieu!&rdquo; cried Père Antoine starting, &ldquo;and is it a palm?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, indeed,&rdquo; returned the man. &ldquo;I did n&rsquo;t reckon the tree would flourish
      in this latitude.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, mon Dieu!&rdquo; was all the priest could say aloud; but he murmured to
      himself, &ldquo;Bon Dieu, vous m&rsquo;avez donné cela!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      If Père Antoine loved the tree before, he worshipped it now. He watered
      it, and nurtured it, and could have clasped it in his arms. Here were
      Emile and Anglice and the child, all in one!
    </p>
    <p>
      The years glided away, and the date-palm and the priest grew together&mdash;only
      one became vigorous and the other feeble. Père Antoine had long passed the
      meridian of life. The tree was in its youth. It no longer stood in an
      isolated garden; for pretentious brick and stucco houses had clustered
      about Antoine&rsquo;s cottage. They looked down scowling on the humble thatched
      roof. The city was edging up, trying to crowd him off his land. But he
      clung to it like lichen and refused to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Speculators piled gold on his doorsteps, and he laughed at them. Sometimes
      he was hungry, and cold, and thinly clad; but he laughed none the less.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get thee behind me, Satan!&rdquo; said the old priest&rsquo;s smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      Père Antoine was very old now, scarcely able to walk; but he could sit
      under the pliant, caressing leaves of his palm, loving it like an Arab;
      and there he sat till the grimmest of speculators came to him. But even in
      death Père Antoine was faithful to his trust.
    </p>
    <p>
      The owner of that land loses it if he harm the date-tree.
    </p>
    <p>
      And there it stands in the narrow, dingy street, a beautiful, dreamy
      stranger, an exquisite foreign lady whose grace is a joy to the eye, the
      incense of whose breath makes the air enamored. May the hand wither that
      touches her ungently!
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Because it grew from the heart of little Anglice</i>,&rdquo; said Miss
      Blondeau tenderly.
